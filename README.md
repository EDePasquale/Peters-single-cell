## Project Description
In this project, the Peters lab performed 5' single-cell RNA-sequencing paired with TCR and BCR detection using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling kit on liver samples collected from pediatric patients with liver rejection following transplantation. For each patient there is at least 1 sample taken from a biopsy time point following transplantation, but there are frequently multiple time points gathered as well as sequecing of the healthy donor prior to transplantation. The goal of this project is to identify T-cell clones that may be driving rejection and to explore their gene expression differences across responses to treatment. Secondary goals include exploration of the BCR data and identification of novel cell states during rejection.
